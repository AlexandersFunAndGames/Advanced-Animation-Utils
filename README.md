# Alexander's Advanced Animation Utils

Alexander's Advanced Animation Utils is a set of utilities that can be added to Minecraft: Java Edition mods to help with animation.
<br>
<br>The project was created for modders who want to move from GeckoLib to the vanilla 1.19+ animation system, but can still be very useful for people already using the vanilla animation system.
<br>
<br>The current features of Alexander's Advanced Animation Utils are using Molang with vanilla models, making animated items, and making non-humanoid mobs able to wear armour.
